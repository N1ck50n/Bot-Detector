Log-Based Activity Detection Report

This report outlines the results of a log analysis aimed at detecting suspicious activity from IP addresses accessing a web service. The purpose was to identify abnormal request patterns that may indicate bot behavior, scraping, or other forms of automated misuse.

Assumptions

    The system under observation is used for music streaming, where high-frequency requests (especially GET) are often legitimate.

    The log format contains identifiable IP addresses and timestamps.

    The company has limited resources and no dedicated bot mitigation infrastructure.

Methodology

A Python script (analyzeLogs.py) was developed to analyze server log files. The script identifies:

    High-volume IPs: Any IP address making over 500 requests during the logging period is flagged as potentially abusive.

    Burst request behavior: IPs making 10 or more requests within 5 seconds are identified using a sliding time window. This pattern is atypical for human interaction and is often associated with automation.

This logic was tested using a sample log file. Thresholds were selected to balance detection sensitivity while minimizing false positives from legitimate users.
Findings

Multiple IPs were found to exceed 1,000 requests, with some exceeding 5,000. Several also exhibited burst activity. These IPs are strong candidates for automated or scripted traffic.
Recommendations

    Block or rate-limit suspicious IPs using firewall rules or server-side controls.

    Schedule daily or hourly scans using the provided script to continuously monitor for abuse.

    Automate deployment using Docker for consistency and ease of use.

    Refine thresholds as more behavioral data becomes available to reduce false positives.

    Enforce usage policies to prohibit abusive automated traffic.

Conclusion

This cost-effective, open-source solution provides an actionable way to detect and manage suspicious traffic, helping safeguard system resources without requiring additional infrastructure or services.
